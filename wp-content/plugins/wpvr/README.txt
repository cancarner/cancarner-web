**Easy and simple interface** 
Simple, easy and straight forward options to add your panorama images and create a tour. 

**Easy direction and navigation tools**
Create multiple hotspots for each scene at your own will. You can add hotspot type: info to get on-click or hover information or add URL. You can use hotspot type: scene and connect it to visit other scenes.

**Customize style easily**
You can implement your own custom style class and, alter the design and display of content from hotspot easily.

**Easy to embed your virtual tour:**
Every tour you create generates a shortcode.
For a classic editor, you can simply apply this shortcode on your page along with proper width and height, and your website will include the virtual tour just the way you want.
For Gutenberg block editor, you will find a block type “WPVR” under the common blocks. Create a WPVR block and on the toolbar, input the ID from the short code and assign your desired height and width, and the virtual tour will be embedded on your web page.
For Elementor page builder, you will find a widget called “WPVR” under the general widgets. Simply add the widget and input ID, and assign height and width (in px) and it will be embedded on your web page.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= 1. Why should I use WPVR? =
You can easily create a Virtual Tour for your place using WPVR. You simply need to provide a 360 degree panoramic photo, and this plugin will create a virtual tour which visitors can navigate easily. You can further add hotspots to include information or add more scenes to navigate to.

= 2. Installation =
You can download the plugin either from wordpress.org or from rextheme.com. Once you have downloaded the file, you can then go to your dashboard, under plugin, select Add New and upload the file. Then Install and activate the plugin. Once activated, on the left side under your dashboard, you will find the option WPVR at the bottom.

= 3. What kind of pictures should I take to use in WPVR? =
To make a perfect equirectangular image, you need to use a 360 degree panoramic photo of the area you want to preview.

= 4. Can I embed images and videos on hotspot? =
Yes, you can include image source or video embed link on the section On Click Content in a hotspot, which will view the image or video when clicked on.

= 5. Can I Customize the Content on the hotspot? =
Yes. You can create a custom class on your theme, stating whatever style you want. Then you can input the class name on the Hotspot Custom Class section in a hotspot, and the content displayed will be customized according to the style you set.

= 6. How can I embed a virtual tour using Gutenberg Block Editor?? =
Under common blocks, you will find a block called WPVR. Add WPVR block. Select the block and on the dynamic toolbar on the right, you will get the options to add ID, Height and Width. Collect the ID from the virtual tour you created. Assign height and width according to your convenience. 

= 7. What do I do if I get “THE FILE (image link) COULD NOT BE ACCESSED” error? =
Sometimes when you add a tour on your site, you might face this issue that rather than loading the tour it will give the error “THE FILE (…) COULD NOT BE ACCESSED.”

This error shows up when you are running a website under “HTTPS” (secured with SSL certificate) whereas your image link is under “HTTP” (unsecured).

To solve this issue, go to your WordPress Dashboard > Settings > General. Here make sure you have “https” added to both “WordPress Address (URL)” and “Site Address (URL)”. That’s it. Your virtual tour will load with no issues.
